**_Abstract_&mdash;With efficiency at the center of Chia's philosophy, several
strategies have come to light to further maximize this earth-friendly attribute.
One of the most anticipated and coincidentally recent approaches is plot
compression, that is, boosting plotting's performance and/or required space
accommodated by specific hardware. In this paper, we traverse the adaptability
of BladeBit, the official yet optional plotter by Chia that incorporates
compression techniques. The alternate plotter from *madMAx* is also included in
the research as collateral.**

**_Index Terms_&mdash;Chia blockchain, plot compression, BladeBit disk**

## I. Introduction

Since its inception in 2008, Bitcoin &mdash; and in turn, the cryptocurrency
movement &mdash; has amassed millions of users across the globe. This trend has
exponentially raised the value of digital coins while emitting massive amounts
of pollution in the process, and it shows no sign of slowing down. Much of the
power hogging is attributed to the consensus model of the blockchain, it
verifies transactions and dictates how new coins are generated.\[1]

In a conventional cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin, proof-of-work
remains the de-facto protocol. Proof-of-work operates by giving the participants
sets of complex mathematical questions that require extreme precision and lots
of computing power. By constantly competing for the fastest and accurate answer,
the system has proved that it is statistically improbable (or financially
unappealing) for a bad actor to manipulate or recreate the blockchain.\[2]

### A. The Downfall of Proof-of-work

For a proof-of-work mechanism to stay robust in a growing market, it would
require a propotional amount of energy and electricity bills. In 2022, it has
reached a point where the global electricity usage of cryptocurrencies has
surpassed the total annual electricity of countries such as Argentina or
Australia. With the increasing popularity of digital assets, the power needed to
run them is expected to exceed the entire traditional servers around the world.\[5]

With Bitcoin's heightening power consumption, it is inevitable that other and
often overlooked consensus models are on the rise. For example, proof-of-stake
first appeared as a hybrid implementation in a cryptocurrency now known as
*Peercoin*.\[3] It only gained acknowledgment after *Ethereum* fully utilized it
in the long-awaited merge. Instead of solving arithmetic problems,
proof-of-stake relies on a voting arrangement where members with higher stakes
have a better chance of winning. It effectively eliminates small players such as
home miners from the competition as they are unable to match the initial
offerings of big organizations.\[6] Additionally, some PoS systems also take into
account the length of time that a stake has been held. Validators who have held
their stake for a longer period of time may have a greater chance of being
chosen to create the next block, as this rewards long-term participation in the
network.

### B. Overview of Chia

This led us to proof-of-space, a protocol of choice by Chia. Unlike the stakes
system, every attempt to participate in proof-of-space is connected to a
real-world object, which in this case, is storage.\[7] This property is
inherently similar to proof-of-work, trading computing power for storage.
However, storage is deemed inexpensive, with prices continuing to plummet.\[8]

Therefore, it can be said that Chia's Proof of Space is designed to be more
accessible than Bitcoin's Proof of Work because it does not require specialized
hardware such as ASICs or GPUs to mine. Instead, it leverages unused storage
space on a user's hard drive to generate new blocks and validate transactions.
This means that almost anyone with a computer and some free hard drive space can
participate in Chia farming, which is the process of generating new blocks and
earning rewards in Chia cryptocurrency. In contrast, Bitcoin's Proof of Work
requires powerful computing hardware and high electricity costs, making it less
accessible to the median users.

Regarding Chia, this network adds a "time" component to the proof-of-space
consensus mechanism. This aspect refers to the requirement that the solutions to
cryptographic puzzles (generated by the Proof of Space component) must also
satisfy a certain time condition. This means that a valid solution to the puzzle
must take a certain amount of time to compute. In order to guarantee this time
component, Chia uses a Verifiable Delay Function (VDF). The key feature of a VDF
is that it takes a certain amount of time to compute the output, even if the
input value is known.

By using a VDF in the plotting process, Chia can ensure that plotting takes a
specific amount of time, regardless of the amount of computational power used.
This helps to prevent centralized mining operations from dominating the network,
and makes it more accessible to individual users with standard computing
equipment.

## II. Proposed Solution

It is important to establish fundamentals about the type and extent of
compression before continuing further into advanced topics. First, there is a
lossless compression, that is, removed parts of the content do not affect the
desired result. For obvious reasons, this is a favored compression method that
has thus far been incorporated in Chia plots and activated by default.\[9]

The other compression type, lossy compression, allows direct manipulation of the
result, to the extent that is agreed upon by the user, to maximize space saving.
In this paper, we explore various methods of lossy compression that are recently
introduced in the Chia ecosystem, either officially or third-party by the
community. Listed below are the compression strategies available now.

### A. Use GPU

Compression with a dedicated graphics card, though still in an experimental
phase, is already the fastest compression technique as the raw speed and memory
capacity of modern GPUs are currently in exponential growth. GPU also costs less
correlative to CPU while generating comparatively additional power. It is even
reported that GPUs with certain raw performance can expect bottlenecks with PCIe
or memory bandwidth.\[10]

GPU plotting is initially supported in a community project known as Chia
*Gigahorse* by prominent member madMAx. Not long after, Chia chimes in with its
official implementation called *BladeBit*. Unfortunately in its current state,
compressing plots using GPU relies heavily on *CUDA* technology invented by
*NVIDIA*, thus hardware support is limited to the brand. And though support for
more GPU vendors is logged in the roadmap, there is no word on when it would be
available or its task priority within the team.

### B. Use RAM or Storage

Lossy compression can alternatively be achieved with extra memory or storage.
This is a more accessible approach not only because both are cheaper than GPU,
but there is also no hardware constraint.

## III. Evaluation

To appropriately measure how well a plot process is doing, it is crucial to
understand what that process undertakes. Each plot can be identified to have 4
phases regardless of the distinct implementation of various plotters. In this
section, we try to interpret what each phase does to our best understanding.

### A. Phase 1: Forward-progragation

![Figure 1.1 &ndash; Phase 1: Temporary and final file layout](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-CS554/raw/assets/bladebit-research/phase1.png)

<small>Figure 1.1 &ndash; Phase 1: Temporary and final file layout</small>

Upon plot creation, Chia spawns a `chia` process that generates cryptographic
hashes starting with a seed value. The plotter first generates a table of random
numbers, which is used to determine the locations of the hashes to be computed.
It also creates and locks the final plot file.

### B. Phase 2: Back-progragation

![Figure 1.2 &ndash; Phase 2: Table illustration within temporary files](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-CS554/raw/assets/bladebit-research/phase2.png)

<small>Figure 1.2 &ndash; Phase 2: Table illustration within temporary files</small>

The plotter then scans the plot file generated in Phase 1 and re-arranges the
data in a way that is more optimized for reading. This involves grouping the
data into buckets and then sorting each bucket. The resulting data is written to
a temporary file.

### C. Phase 3: Compression

![Figure 1.3 &ndash; Phase 3: Migrating to double-pointers](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-CS554/raw/assets/bladebit-research/phase3.png)

<small>Figure 1.3 &ndash; Phase 3: Migrating to double-pointers</small>

Chia compresses the data generated in phases 2 using a compression algorithm
called *Zstd* to reduce the size of the final plot. This process involves
removing duplicate data and optimizing the remaining data for storage
efficiency. As we have explained before, this would be the lossless compression
that Chia does by default, and it has the purpose of making the data easier to
transfer over the network.\[11]

### D. Phase 4: Completion

![Figure 1.4 &ndash; Phase 4: Writing final file](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-CS554/raw/assets/bladebit-research/phase4.png)

<small>Figure 1.4 &ndash; Phase 4: Writing final file</small>

The final phase consists of bucket sorting and writing the compressed data to
the final plot file while emptying the temporary directory. This sorting is
preferably conducted on RAM, and during our experiment 32GB is usually enough
for k32 size. Failing this crucial hardware requirement, the sorting would then
resort to persistently on disk, which varies by implementation but is most
definitely slower than RAM.

In the background, the process also generates a proof file which essentially is
a guarantee that the plot data was correctly generated. The proof file is used
by the Chia blockchain to verify that a farmer has a valid plot file. Once the
final plot file and proof file are generated, the plotting process is complete
and the farmer can start farming Chia.

## IV. Findings

| System requirement | Minimum | Recommended | Testbed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CPU | 4 cores | 8 cores | 6 cores |
| RAM | 16GB | 32GB | 32GB |
| Boot drive | SSD SATA | SSD NVMe | SSD NVMe |
| Temporary directory | &ndash; | HDD 8TB | HDD 4TB |
| Final directory | HDD | SSD | HHD |

**Detailed specifications**: *Gigabyte* B460M Aorus Pro, *Intel* Core i5-10400,
*AMD* Sapphire Pulse RX 580 8GB, *Corsair* Vengeance LPX DDR4 2666MHz 4x8GB,
*Samsung* 970 EVO NVMe M.2 250GB, *Toshiba* X300 3.5 HDD 4TB,
*Apple* macOS Ventura 13.3.1

We propose test results from our testbed which ranks between the minimum and
recommended system requirements Chia has posted in their official documentation.
This commodity hardware will be tested against 3 plotters:

- **pos** &ndash; *Chia Proof of Space 1.0.11*: The default plotter.
- **bb** &ndash; *BladeBit Plotter 2.0.1 (Disk plot)*: The optional plotter
  managed by Chia.
- **mm** &ndash; *madMAx Plotter (1.1.6-2092041)*: The alternate plotter
  managed by the community.

![Figure 2.1 &ndash; k25 plotting time](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-CS554/raw/assets/bladebit-research/finding1.png)

<small>Figure 2.1 &ndash; k25 plotting time</small>

Unsurprisingly, k25 plotters are finished within minutes of conception. Plot
size k25 generates too less cryptographic hashes to be considered secure for
general use. Due to this characteristic, the mainnet no longer permits plot
sizes under k32 since 2021 and is confirmed to stand until the end of 2023.\[12]
It is a 2-level upgrade from the k30 agreement first set in 2020.

![Figure 2.2 &ndash; k32 plotting time](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-CS554/raw/assets/bladebit-research/finding2.png)

<small>Figure 2.2 &ndash; k32 plotting time</small>

k32 plot size is the most popular, minimum requirement of the mainnet network
and the BladeBit plotters. The plotters average around 13 hours of completion,
although expansive, is still within range of what is acceptable according to
available reports. What was an unforeseen discovery for us is the alternate
plotter from madMAx, despite being wildly popular, needs additional 3 hours to
accomplish than the default plotter.

Regrettably, multiple attempts to finalize the BladeBit disk plotter test all
fail due to indistinguishable errors during Phase 2. As we navigate through
experimental builds of BladeBit, it is clear to us that our case is not
isolated.\[13]

![Figure 2.3 &ndash; Average by k-size](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-CS554/raw/assets/bladebit-research/finding3.png)

<small>Figure 2.3 &ndash; Average by k-size</small>

Our final graph indicates the average time needed for each k-size. Given the k25
and k32 elapsed plotting time, we estimate 2.17 times increase for every k-level
increment.

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
  0.06 . n^{32-25} &=& 13.96 \\\\
  n^{7} &=& 232.67 \\\\
  n &=& 2.17
\end{array}
$$

## V. Related Work

The possibility of compressing plots was initially accepted by Chia in
January 2023. By February, unofficial development builds by madMAx had recorded
plots with this capability. Chia has finally entered the field by releasing
BladeBit in March as an optional plot. All this progression happen quite
recently, thus we are unable to find related work regarding this topic.

However, the whole concept can be traced back to a 2008 study to compress
Bitcoin's node by a group of Indonesian researchers.\[4] Nevertheless citing
their work in ours would be futile as they are inherently different by consensus
model.

## VI. Conclusion

Our tests prove that the BladeBit disk plotter is unusable in its current state.
The process seems to always fail in Phase 2 and we have been able to identify
this problem on all versions dating back to version 2.0.0 based on official Git
issue trackers under the control of Chia. However, while studying how each
plotting phase operates, we have concluded that the time required to complete
Phase 3 is identical to Phase 1. This leaves us with Phase 4, the fastest
recorded phase consistently finishing under an hour in k32 size provided that
the system's RAM is sufficient.

Using this knowledge, albeit inconclusive, we can theorize that commodity
hardware can expect approximately 1-2 hours of saving with k32 size when using
the BladeBit disk plotter. Out of the expected 12.5 hours needed to complete
using our commodity hardware, this saving amounts to about 10-15%.

As a bonus of the research we also take a quick look at an alternate plotter by
madMAx. Unfortunately, it can be inferred that madMAx plotter performs worse
than the default Chia Proof of Space plotter, averaging 52% slowdown in k25 and
23% in k32. When compared to a more formidable yet deficient BladeBit disk
plotter, the time elapsed of madMAx's alternate plotter is even worse at 35-45%.

### A. Reflection

There are several ways we can evaluate and dictate whether or not this research
is a success. Sadly, it is a failure if we measure by the produced data because
BladeBit has unexpectedly misbehaved. Nonetheless, our study of general and
alternate plots still stands.

### B. Future Work

![Figure 3 &ndash; Future work](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-CS554/raw/assets/bladebit-research/types.png)

<small>Figure 3 &ndash; Future work</small>

The tests listed in the finding section are performed solely on disk. With such
a perspective, future explorations could leverage other parts of hardware namely
RAM and GPU, both of which are foreseen to exceed the achievement of any
persistent disk. Woefully, some of them have demands that are unrealistic for
most desktop builds, look no further than the BladeBit RAM plotter with
approximately 400GB of RAM pre-requisite. A note regarding GPU, madMAx has also
released his implementation of GPU plotting called Gigahorse.
