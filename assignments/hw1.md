# [Homework 1](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-CS554/blob/assets/assignments/hw1.pdf): Blockchain Technology

> Write a 1-page essay (1” margins, 11-point font Arial or Times New Roman,
  single spaced, single column) on what you believe Blockchain Technologies to
  be. Identify 3 major problems that blockchain technologies solves. Discuss
  alternate solutions to what Blockchain proposes. Clearly articulate if you
  believe Blockchains to be a subject that will rise and fall with limited scope
  and duration, or if you believe Blockchains is a technology that is here to
  stay and will likely grow in adoption for the foreseeable future. Regardless
  of what you believe, what are the top two issues with blockchain technologies
  that you believe must be solved before Blockchain technologies can become
  mainstream.

In my opinion, [Blockchain technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain.com)
is essentially a `Linked List` networking system, the same way I would
characterize [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) as a `JSON` object. To
view or add something to the network, one would have to navigate the list by
going to the next node of each one. This node traversion prevents the list from
being changed, as doing so would cause losing access to the next node, thereby
breaking the whole chain.

The whole point of this chaining mechanism is to provide a decentralized network
that does not bow to a company or government. With immutability and transparency
in mind, blockchain is created to be more failproof than a conventional
centralized system. But it has some drawbacks. For one, it is noticeably slower
than a conventional centralized system, as preserving data in this linked-list
manner would carry more operations. There is also a complex validation procedure
set in place that will negatively impact performance and energy consumption.

Blockchain is first conceived as part of [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)
and the bigger *Cryptocurrency* movement, they provide an alternative to the
current centralized financial system we have all accustomed to. But since the
technology that enables its existence is made open-source, people have been
adapting and decentralizing every industry with it. There is even a startup that
uses blockchain for counting votes in elections.<sup>[\[1\]]</sup> Nevertheless,
with cryptocurrency (and recently [Non-Fungible Tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token))
being the largest contributor to the cause, it is inevitable that blockchain's
success will be tied to crypto.

Over the course of its short lifespan of just over 14 years, crypto has risen
from get-rich-quick schemes among early adopters to the mainstream. We have seen
their valuations grow and shrink over and over
again.<sup>[\[2\]]</sup><sup>[\[3\]]</sup> It has since garnered recognition in
a few countries, sparked a revolution and debate about human interaction with
money.<sup>[\[4\]]</sup><sup>[\[5\]]</sup>

This paper has the advantage of knowing recent events of crypto downfalls such
as the cryptocurrency crackdown on China and the [FTX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX)
exchange collapse.<sup>[\[6\]]</sup><sup>[\[7\]]</sup> Going forward, it is my
inherent belief that crypto cannot co-exist without any form of regulation or
punishment for the bad actors. However failproof they may be, science alone
cannot undertake this heavy task of replacing all existing banks. In comparison,
I would like to draw a precedent from [self-driving car technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car)
in its initial form not too long ago. The United States has acknowledged the
possibility of smart vehicles since 2012, there were doubts in those days about
computer reliability and cyber security.<sup>[\[8\]]</sup> But within just under
a decade, the government has demonstrated multiple capacities to pass bills,
establish standards, and reduce human errors to improve automated driving for
the years to come.<sup>[\[9\]]</sup><sup>[\[10\]]</sup><sup>[\[11\]]</sup> I argue
that given the scope and impact of various cryptocurrencies on society, they
warrant the same government involvement as self-driving car technology does.

There is also an equally concerning internal-design issue of sustainability
besides the external changes, like regulations. For some of time now, it has
been an accepted consensus that crypto is a major electricity
hog.<sup>[\[12\]]</sup> This revelation has prompted *Ethereum*, the largest
cryptocurrency at the time, to take an unprecendented initiative to mitigate the
carbon footprint by modifying fundamental verification concept that has been in
place for all cryptocurrencies.<sup>[\[13\]]</sup>
